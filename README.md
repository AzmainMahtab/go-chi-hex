## 🚀 Go Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) Boilerplate ##

A production-ready, strictly typed implementation of Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in Go.

This project focuses on type safety, separation of concerns, and long-term maintainability, moving away from "stringly-typed" maps and towards a robust domain-centric core.
